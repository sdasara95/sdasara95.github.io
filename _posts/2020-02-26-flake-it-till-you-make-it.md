It's been 10 days since I graduated (Okay 9 days to be precise). Time really does pass by quickly. I feel like I landed in USA a few months back though it's been nearly 2 years since I step foot here. I guess when I landed here I must have had crazy dreams of a 100K job lined up when I graduate, fun trips to Miami and Vegas, huge social network etc. Being an international graduate student enrolled in a STEM major leaves you with barely any time to explore the outside world. The high academic workload coupled with internship and job search makes sure that you don't slack off. It's good in a way though, keeps you mentally active but then again, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. I have noticed that my usual life of sitting infront of a laptop or computer and working all day has led to deterioration of my social skills. Also the current COVID situation has prevented me from even making an attempt at socialising ðŸ˜‚. 

Stimulation of the right (creative) side of the brain is often neglected by people in STEM. I figured that given the current circumstances the world is in and the not so-good-outlook of my job-search efforts, starting a blog is a good way to motivate myself, tap into my creative self and stay upbeat( especially about life in general). This website took two days to create, not bad for someone who lost touch with front-end long ago. It's great that open-source code is so freely available in this time and age. You can literally do anything you want to if you know how to code. However, coding does take time to be good at.

Life is very weird, for some things go according to plan, for others things go nothing as per their plan. Then you have those who never plan and have a totally nomadic approach of living in the moment and going wherever the wind takes them. I have seen success and failure cases in all the three viewpoints. I am figuring out where do I fit in. Honestly I am a mix of all three. But then again, it's a common flaw of us humans to broadly categorize all phenomena into finite categories. If anything life has taught me, it is that the variables involved in the working of this universe is uncountable. Hence, maybe we should just go our own route treating every action of ours as a learning experience. Learning experience is often conflated with right and wrong doing. In my opinion it's more of what is apt for the situation at hand. Sometimes making a plan makes no sense. Other times, it makes sense like when you go for groceries.
