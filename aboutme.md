I am **Satya Dasara**, a data scientist with **M.S. in Data Science** from **IU Bloomington**. I have had two data science internships at startups which allowed me to work in a high paced environment on **computer vision, quantitative analysis** and **natural language processing projects**. I have mostly worked in small teams with minimal supervision satisfying the clients’ demands and delivering projects on time. I consider myself as a **self-sufficient worker** who can learn new technologies and concepts while simultaneously working at the highest standard. I believe my inquisitiveness and analytical mindset makes me an **immediate contributor for my employer**. I am also an avid reader of research papers and technical articles. My **interests** are primarily **data** and **AI related**. Apart from work my hobbies include sketching and watching MMA. <br />
