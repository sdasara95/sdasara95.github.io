I have been involved in the field of data science, AI/ML, deep learning for over 7 years. I graduated with **M.S. in Data Science** from **IU Bloomington** in **May** of **2020** and worked for **5 years** as a **Senior Software Engineer (AI/ML)** at [**Talentsky Inc**](https://talentsky.com/) a **Series B** startup worth over **40 million dollars** building a skills network.

I consider myself as a **self-sufficient worker** who can learn and adapt to new technologies and concepts on the fly while simultaneously working at the highest standard.
