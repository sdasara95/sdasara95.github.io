My work revolves around **statistics** and **linear algebra** with maybe a little bit of **calculus**.<br>
The thing with math is that you remember it only if you **regularly practice** it. <br>
I have some great references which I suggest for timely repetitive referencing. <br>

This is hands down the best intro YouTube channel for statistics. <br>
